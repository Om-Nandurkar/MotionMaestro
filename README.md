# MotionMaestro
Motion Maestro is a web-based application designed to detect and translate American Sign Language(ASL) 
hand gestures into text in real-time. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system 
processes video input from a webcam, classifies the gestures, and displays the corresponding text on 
the screen.
